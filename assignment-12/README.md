# Assignment 12

1.  The difference between padding, margin, and borders is in what spaces they influence; padding controls the spacing between a element's content and its border, margin controls the spacing between the border and other elements on the page, and borders are used to create visible lines around elements (these lines can also be invisible, as they are the perimeter of the element's box).
2. This week's assignment actually went fairly well, the only thing I ran into that took a bit of time working through was making sure that the header was correct on each linked page, and not broken for any of the pages. This was fixed easily by just copy and pasting the intitial code I had used for the first page.
