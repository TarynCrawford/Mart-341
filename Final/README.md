# Final
## Taryn Crawford
I had a lot of fun working on this final project. Mostly as it came to the CSS. To make the site look cohesive I made sure to use the same color theme throughout each page, with the home page being the only one that is primarally white. 

I really wanted to make this site responsive, so I have a lot of media queries for each page and I made it so that the nav bar tabs would turn into a menu when the screen is smaller. I had some trouble getting the menu to stay at the right side of the screen, but eventually I managed to get it to work.

I really enjoyed the time I spent in this class and it was fun to go back and relearn some of the things I have forgotten. This class really helped revive my love for web development.
