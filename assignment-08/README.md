1. An affordance is defined as potential interactions between an object and user. This can be a number of situations. For example, a button on a webpage. The user has the option to hover over and click the button on that page. Another real world example is a door knob. A user can twist the door knob to open a door.
2. Some advantages of using a third-party service to host your videos would include it being very easy to place a video on your webpage from these services. However, a disadvantage would be that videos can often be taken down without you realizing, leaving an empty video player on your site.
3. Some challenges I faced this week was trying to get the embedded YouTube video to work properly, as it wasn't showing up for me when I embedded it. I had to check with GitHub to see if it actually worked when implemented.
