1. Web browsers function with a series of events. After looking up a webpage, your browser will send a request to the server. This allows it to access the html, css, and other documents attached. The browser interprets it into a webpage onscreen that the user can see and interact with. I mainly use Google Chrome to surf the web, but I occassionally use firefox if I run into compatability issues.
