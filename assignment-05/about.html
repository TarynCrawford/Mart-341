        <h1>Characters</h1>
        
        <h2>Pazu</h2>
            <img src="./images/Pazu.webp" width="350" height="490" alt="Picture of Pazu from Castle in the Sky"/>
            <p>Pazu is an energetic, amicable young boy with a heart of gold, always willing to help out wherever needed. He's a dedicated and hard worker in the mines, and is also particularly enamored with technology.</p>
                
        <h2>Sheeta</h2>
            <img src="./images/Sheeta.webp" width="350" height="490" alt="Picture of Sheeta from Castle in the Sky"/>
            <p>Sheeta is a 13-year old orphan who lived alone in a farm at Gondoa. She is actually of royal descent; once belonging to the long forgotten kingdom of Laputa. She possesses an Aetherium crystal, an heirloom coveted by the Dola gang, Colonel Muska, and the military.</p>
           
        <h2>Dola</h2>
            <img src="./images/Dola.webp" width="350" height="490" alt="Picture of Dola from Castle in the Sky"/>
            <p>Captain Dola is the tritagonist of Laputa: Castle in the Sky. At the beginning, Dola acts and seems like a no good pirate. However, after she lets Pazu and Sheeta onto her team, she softens up and is affectionate and caring, like a mother but with pirate qualities.</p>
                
        <h2>Muska</h2>
            <img src="./images/Muska.webp" width="350" height="490" alt="Picture of Muska from Castle in the Sky"/>
            <p>At first, he seems to treat Sheeta well, offering her fine clothes and acting somewhat kindly toward her, but Muska is truly cold, calculating and duplicitous, and will turn on his allies once he has used them to attain his goals.</p>
