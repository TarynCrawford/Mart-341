# Assignment 9
## Taryn Crawford
1. Most of the basics concerning HTML was old for me,but it was nice to be able to refresh my knowledge of semantic markup and divs.
2. I am excited to dive into CSS because I find it as a much more concise and organized way to design my webpages. It will make it much easier to keep my different pages consistent. I am hoping that I will be able to learn something new or relearn some of my forgotten knowledge.
