    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Katsu Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>1/2</b> cup ketchup</li>
      <li><b>2</b> tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li><b>2</b> teaspoons brown suger</li>
      <li><b>1</b> tablespoon mirin</li>
      <li><b>2</b> teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li><b>1</b> teaspoon freshly grated ginger</li>
      <li><b>1</b> teaspoon finely minced garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chicken Katsu</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>1</b> pound of boneless skinless chicken breast cut in half horizontally</li>
      <li> salt</li>
      <li><b>1 1/2</b> cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li><b>3</b> eggs</li>
      <li><b>1 1/2</b> tablespoons water</li>
      <li><b>3</b> cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
      <li> Vegetable oil for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Katsu Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Place all of the ingredients in a small bowl, and stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Let the sauce rest at least 30 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Chicken Katsu</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place halved chicken breast between some plastic wrap and gently pound out the chicken until it is about ¼ inch thick.</li>
      <li>Salt the chicken liberally, cover, and place in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. This will help the chicken break down and become super juicy. You could omit this step, but the chicken will come out better if you let the chicken rest.</li>
      <li>Set up a breading station with three bowls. Place the all-purpose flour into one bowl. Beat the eggs and 1 1/2 tablespoons of water together very well, and pour into a second bowl. Place the panko breadcrumbs into the third bowl.</li>
      <li>Coat the chicken as follows: Place the chicken into the flour and shake off any excess. Dip into the egg wash, coat well, and shake off any excess. Dredge in the panko breadcrumbs.</li>
      <li>Place the coated chicken on a wire rack.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to <i>200°</i>.</li>
      <li>Add enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom ½ inch of either an iron skillet or a stainless steel pan and heat to 350°F. Your pan should be large enough not to overcrowd the chicken.</li>
      <li>Add the chicken to the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, just until the crust sets.</li>
      <li>Flip over and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Continue cooking the chicken and flipping it over until it is golden brown on both sides.</li>
      <li>Remove the chicken and place on a clean wire rack. Place into the preheated oven to finish cooking. Depending on the thickness of your chicken, the chicken may need another 7 or 8 minutes of cooking. Chicken should be <b>165 degrees F</b> before consuming.</li>
      <li>When the chicken is fully cooked, cut into thin strips that you can pick up with chopsticks.</li>
      <li>Serve with rice, tonkatsu sauce, or your favorite brown sauce.</li>
    </ol>
