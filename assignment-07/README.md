1. 1. Most forms I come across on the web follow a similar format, typically having boxes to enter in information, often of yourself, with submit buttons at the bottom to submit all of the information. They typically serve the purpose to give the website owners information they need to remember who you are, usually in the form of usernames or passwords. Moodle requires the user to put in their id and password in order to access their informtion. So do sites like amazon and the majority of sites that need to have personalized information from each user. 
2. A text input can be used for usernames, or anything that can have a large variety of inputs.. For selection input, these can be used to determine information based on premade selections. This could be for letting someone select information like the state that they live in or their gender, or an option that they would like to have. For button input, these can be used to determine an action the user would like to take, for example, a search button.
