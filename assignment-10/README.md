1. Selectors allow you to select different elements of an html page. Universal selects the entire page, while element selects an individual element,and  class selects the class of a div you set. An id selects only an element with a certain id for its div. You may use these differently to select certain parts of a webpage you want to style, instead of just one element or the entire page. This allows for further customization, however a broader look might make a site look more coheasive. 
2. For my color palette I found a photo that I liked on the web, and picked the main colors from it. It made for a very bright and vibrant site mixed with a few neutrals to bring it back down to earth.
3. This week I didn't really face many challanges but I did find myself experimenting a lot. It would have been easier for myself if I had used a live site as I found myself constently reloading my webpage to see my changes.
